# N-Queens

o Domain: DSA | Programming Language: C++

The N-Queens project is a C++ implementation of a backtracking algorithm to solve the classic N-Queens problem on a chessboard. The goal is to arrange N queens on an NxN chessboard in such a way that no two queens can attack each other. In chess, queens can move vertically, horizontally, and diagonally, so the challenge is to place the queens in non-attacking positions.
    
The program utilizes object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and creates an efficient data structure using a 2D array (grid) to represent the chessboard and store the queen positions. The backtracking algorithm systematically explores possible configurations and checks for a valid solution while avoiding conflicts between queens.


**Input 1:**
```input
Enter the number of Queen: 4
```
**Output 1:**
```output
0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 
0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 
1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 
0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 


0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 
1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 
0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 
0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 
```
**Input 2:**
```input
Enter the number of Queen: 3
```
**Output 2:**
```output
-1
```
